# PrepareWorkspace
This bot prepares a job at the university. He logs on to websites related to the university and also allows you to open additional pages. Thanks to the add-on written in c ++, the bot script is able to change the mouse sensitivity and precision

The bot was written by me some time ago, so there are no meny commits in this project. It was never meant to be added to my github
